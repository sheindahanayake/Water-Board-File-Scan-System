# Water Board Consumer Management System

This project is a **Water Board Consumer Management System** built with **React** for the frontend and **Laravel** for the backend. It allows users to manage consumer records by performing operations such as **add**, **delete**, and **view** consumer information stored in a **SQL database**.

## Features

- **Scan Consumer Files**: Automatically scan and display consumer records.
- **Add Consumer**: Add new consumer records to the database.
- **Delete Consumer**: Delete existing consumer records from the database.
- **View Data**: Display consumer records from the SQL database.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Laravel (PHP)
- **Database**: MySQL (or any SQL-based database)
- **Local Server**: PHP built-in server or XAMPP/Laragon for local development

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-board-consumer-management.git
```

### 2. Set up the Backend (Laravel)

#### Prerequisites:
- Install **PHP** (Laravel's runtime)
- Install **Composer** (PHP dependency manager)

#### Steps:
1. Navigate to the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd water-board-consumer-management/backend
   ```

2. Install Laravel dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Configure your database settings in the `.env` file (MySQL or any other SQL database):

   ```ini
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=water_board
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   ```

5. Run the Laravel migrations to set up the database:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. Start the Laravel development server:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

   The backend will now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Set up the Frontend (React)

#### Prerequisites:
- Install **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager)

#### Steps:
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd water-board-consumer-management/frontend
   ```

2. Install React dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following RESTful API endpoints for managing consumers:

- **GET /api/consumers**: Retrieve a list of all consumers.
- **POST /api/consumers**: Add a new consumer.
- **DELETE /api/consumers/{id}**: Delete a consumer by ID.

### 5. Frontend Features

The frontend allows users to interact with the consumer data:

- **Add Consumer**: Use the "Add Consumer" form to input new consumer information (Name, Address, Contact, etc.) and submit it to the backend.
- **Delete Consumer**: Click the "Delete" button next to a consumer's name to remove them from the database.
- **View Consumers**: View the list of consumers pulled from the database, with details such as Name, Address, and Contact.

### 6. SQL Database Schema

The MySQL database has the following table to store consumer records:

#### Consumers Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE consumers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    contact VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 7. Deployment

For production deployment, you can:

- Set up a production MySQL server and update the `.env` file with the correct credentials.
- Use a production-ready server like **Nginx** or **Apache** to serve the Laravel application.
- Build the React app for production:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- Deploy the React build folder to the production server and configure it to work with the Laravel backend.

### 8. Troubleshooting

- **Laravel errors**: If you encounter errors related to the database or migrations, check that your database is correctly set up and that you have run the migrations (`php artisan migrate`).
- **Frontend errors**: If you face issues with the React app, ensure that you have installed all the required dependencies (`npm install`) and that the app is properly communicating with the backend.
